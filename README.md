# ICD API Sample code in C# Programming Language

ICD API allows programmatic access to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

More information on the ICD API can be found here:
https://icd.who.int/icdapi

The source code provided in these samples can be run on .NetCore as well as on the full .Net Framework. 

We provide two separate projects: one for the .Net Framework 4.7 and one for .Net Core 2.0
However, the actual C# code is identical in these projects.
